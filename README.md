This is a project started by Brett Ammeson and Joshua Keller under the supervision of Professor Manzo at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA.
The idea is to design a free and open-source sample library and player similar to Kontakt.
We have been synthesizing sounds from programs like Sibelius and FLStudio.
The original design is intended to be in Max 6, with a possible change to C++ or another language that can be run on Linux in addition to Windows and Macintosh.
